# Codenext

This is a project to understand how platforms like LeetCode, Codewars, and other platforms works. Aimed at exploring the inner workings of coding platforms by creating a simplified version for experimentation and analysis. Unlike traditional coding platforms, CodeNext is not intended for public use but rather serves as a sandbox environment for studying the execution of code, generating statistics, and understanding the underlying mechanics of coding challenges.
